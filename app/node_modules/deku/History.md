0.1.1 / 2015-04-22
==================

 * Replaced lodash and removed unused modules

0.1.0 / 2015-04-21
==================

Breaking
 * Updated the top-level API. It now mounts virtual nodes instead of components directly.
 * Removed the `component()` DSL. Components are just objects now with no concept of `this`. This is one step towards making hook functions pure.
 * There is no more `this` in any of the functions used in a component. Instead of `this.setState`, the last argument to the function is `setState`, or `send` (think of it as sending changes to the UI).
 * Removed tagName parsing (eg. `dom('div.foo')`) as it was slowing things down

New Features
 * Added key diffing using the `key` attribute on virtual nodes
 * Added optional prop validation via `propTypes`
 * Added defaultProps hook to components
 * Added the ability for components to access data on the app. This makes it easy to side-load data.

 * Fixed bug with inputs/textarea being pooled incorrectly

 * dom: Cleaned up removing of elements

0.0.30 / 2015-03-27
==================

 * Added DOM pooling

0.0.29 / 2015-03-24

 * Tests now using ES6

0.0.27 / 2015-02-26
==================

 * Fixed bug with re-rendering child nodes

0.0.26 / 2015-02-26
==================

* The renderer now renders the entire tree whenever it is dirty and no longer performs shallow equality checks to determine if a component should update. This means that when a component changes, the entire tree below it is re-rendered, including all nested components. This helps to prevent annoying bugs with objects changing and the UI not updating.
* The scene continues to update on every frame, but will still only actually render a component in the tree has changed.
* There is a new shouldUpdate hook available to components to optimize this. You can stop it from re-rendering a component by returning false from this method.
* Removed channels from the API. This was an experimental API and it turned out to be the wrong abstraction when using it in practice. It was making the library responsible for more than it should be.
* The entities now don't know about the scene at all, making them completely decoupled from it.
* The HTMLRenderer now keeps track of the entity state and structure. This allows the entity to become a wrapper around the user component and only provide managing the state/props from the component.
* The scene will now pause when there is an error during rendering to prevent endless errors.
* The scene methods no longer return a promise. It was never used in practice because the top level components are never used in flow control.
* The diff is now slightly more decoupled, which will allow it to be extracted from deku.
* Removed some unused dependencies. This should make the whole library smaller.
* The logic around commiting changes to props/state in the entity has been reworked. It's now much simpler and less prone to bugs.
